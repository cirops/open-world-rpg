## 1. Problem / Goal

Provide a reliable combat fallback when stealth fails, on the same hex map.

## 2. User Story

As the Hero, I want clear turn-based combat to survive blown infiltrations.

## 3. Non-goals

- Advanced abilities and complex cover systems

## 4. UX Sketch / Notes

- AP, turn indicator, simple damage floaters

- Turn order, AP spend, melee/ranged, basic cover bonus

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- None for MVP

## 9. Dependencies / Risks

- Depends on hex/pathfinding and infiltration map

## 10. Test Plan
